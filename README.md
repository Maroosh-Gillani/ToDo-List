# ToDo-List
Built a ToDo List to get more comfortable with JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

To run the ToDo List, download the each of the three files, putting all in one folder. Then, run the HTML file on an Internet Browser such as Google Chrome.

I was inspired by Tyler Potts' YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkESyVB4oUw&list=WL&index=14

Thanks so much, Tyler!
